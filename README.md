## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS flexbox
- CSS grid
- Media queries

### What I learned

1. CSS Custom Properties:
I've learned how to define and use CSS variables using the ':root' selector. These variables make it easy to manage and customize styles throughout the project.
```css
:root {
    --clr-primary-hsl-400: 252, 100%, 67%;
    --clr-neutral-hsl-100: 0, 0%, 100%;
    --fs-400: 1.125rem;
}
```
2. Media Queries for Responsive Design:
I've learned how to use media queries to apply different styles based on the screen size. This ensures that the website is responsive and looks good on various devices.
```css
@media (min-width: 600px) {
    /* Styles for screens with a minimum width of 600px */
}
```
3. Gradient Backgrounds
I've learned how to create gradient backgrounds using CSS, which can add depth and visual appeal to elements like buttons.
```css
.button:hover,
.button:focus-visible {
    background: var(--gradient-primary);
}
```
4. Styling SVGs and Images
I've learned how to ensure that images and SVGs are displayed correctly with maximum width and other styles applied.
```css
.flex-group {
    display: flex;
    /* Flexbox styles */
}
```
5. Consistent Typography
I've learned how to maintain consistent typography by using custom font variables for font sizes and weights.
```css
body {
    font-family: var(--font-family-default);
    font-size: var(--fs-400);
}
```

### Continued development

Where I want to focus in my future projects:
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- CSS preprocessors like SASS
- Responsive Design
- Web Accessibility

### Useful resources
